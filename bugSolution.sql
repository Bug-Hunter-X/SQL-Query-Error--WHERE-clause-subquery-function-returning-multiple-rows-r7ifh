The solution depends on the specific context. If it's a subquery, using `EXISTS` can resolve the issue.  If it is a UDF (User-Defined Function), the UDF needs modification to always return a single boolean value. 
Here are examples for both cases:

**1. Using EXISTS for Subqueries:**
Instead of:
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department IN (SELECT dept_id FROM departments WHERE location = 'London');
```
Use:
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM departments WHERE location = 'London' AND departments.dept_id = employees.department);
```
This checks if there is at least one department in London matching the employee's department. 

**2. Modifying a User Defined Function:**
Let's assume this is the faulty UDF:
```sql
--Faulty UDF that might return multiple rows
CREATE FUNCTION IsDiscounted (product_id INT) 
RETURNS TABLE (is_discounted BIT) AS
BEGIN
    RETURN SELECT CASE WHEN discount > 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS is_discounted FROM ProductDiscounts WHERE product_id = @product_id;
END;
```
We modify it to return a single boolean value:
```sql
--Corrected UDF
CREATE FUNCTION IsDiscounted (product_id INT) 
RETURNS BIT AS
BEGIN
    DECLARE @isDiscounted BIT;
    SELECT @isDiscounted = CASE WHEN EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM ProductDiscounts WHERE product_id = @product_id AND discount > 0) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END;
    RETURN @isDiscounted;
END;
```
This version checks if a discount exists and returns a single BIT value.
